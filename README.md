The WeatherFlow PiConsole is a Python console that displays the data collected
by a WeatherFlow Tempest or Smart Home Weather Station. The console uses either
the WeatherFlow REST API and websocket service or the local UDP connection to
stream data from your station in real time, including the 3-second rapid wind
updates. In UDP only mode, the console requires no connection to the internet
once installation is complete.

The console is currently compatible with Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 running 32 bit
Raspberry Pi OS with the Official 7 inch touchscreen or equivalent. It can also
be run on a PC with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later, or Raspberry Pi OS. For full
system compatibility details, see below. Support for Raspberry Pi 5 is coming
soon.

## Compatibility

### Raspberry Pi

The console is fully supported for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+, Raspberry Pi 4 and
Raspberry Pi 5 running the 32 or 64 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS. It can be 
run on earlier models, but no direct support is  provided for these systems. It 
is not compatible with Raspberry Pi Zero or Zero W. While the console is 
compatiable with Raspberry Pi 3, the graphics hardware on this model is ageing 
and performance of the console can be sluggish. It is recommended to use a Pi 4 
or above

For all models of Raspberry Pi, the console is compatible with Raspberry Pi OS 
Bookworm and Trixie (soon to be released) or the legacy Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye. 
The console is not compatible with Raspberry Pi OS Buster.

The console is compatible with the Raspberry Pi Official 7 inch Touchscreen or
other HDMI equivalents. Note, screens that attach solely to the GPIO pins (SPI)
are not compatible and the console will not start.

### PC / Laptop

The console is fully supported on laptops and PCs running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or
later, or the desktop version of Raspberry Pi OS. It will run on other
debian-based operating systems with Python version 3.9 or above, but no direct
support is provided for these environments.

## Installation Instructions

The installation of the WeatherFlow PiConsole is fully automated, and can
be started from the terminal with a single command. The automated installation
should take no longer than 10 minutes.

The automated installer assumes you have already sucesfully setup your Raspberry
Pi and have installed Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop, or you ar running on a PC
with Ubuntu 20.04 or later or Raspberry Pi OS installed. For a Raspberry Pi you
should have also attached the touch screen, and have either a keyboard and mouse
attached directly to the Pi, or have accessesd the Pi remotely through SSH/VNC.
If you are starting from scratch with a Raspberry Pi, the documentation should
help get you started:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/

### Install WeatherFlow PiConsole

The WeatherFlow PiConsole can be installed quickly and conveniently with the
following command:
```
curl -sSL https://peted-davis.github.io/wfpiconsole | bash
```
Piping a command directly to ```bash``` is controversial, as it prevents the
user from reading code that is about to run on their system. If you are worried
about the contents of the installer, please examine the [first](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peted-davis/peted-davis.github.io/master/wfpiconsole)
and [second](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PiConsole/master/wfpiconsole.sh)
installation files in the Git repository before running the install command.

### Configure and Run WeatherFlow PiConsole

When the console is run for the first time, you'll first be asked whether you 
want to install a blank configuration file for demonstration purposes or 
advanced setup. You can use this option if you wish to try out the console 
before your WeatherFlow hardware has arrived, or if you are a power user and 
wish to configure the console manually rather than using the configuration 
wizard. For most users, the advanced installation option is not appropriate and 
the default option of 'no' should be selected at this prompt. If you choose to 
install a blank configuration file, the console will start but no data will 
show unless you edit the configuration file manually. 

You will also be prompted to specify your preferred connection type: Websocket 
and REST API (default), UDP and REST API, or UDP only. For UDP only you will be
required to manually enter futher information about your station (location,
name, elevation etc.). For Websocket and REST API or UDP and REST API you will
be asked to enter a WeatherFlow Personal Access Token and a CheckWX Aviation
Weather API key. The Personal Access Token is required for the PiConsole to
access the data from your station, and the CheckWX API key is required to
download the closest METAR information to your station location.

A Personal Access Token can be generated, viewed, and deleted here: 
https://tempestwx.com/settings/tokens, and a CheckWX API key can be obtained by 
registering for a free account here: https://www.checkwxapi.com/auth/signup

Once you have a Personal Access Token and registered with CheckWX (if required),
go ahead and run the console for the first time using:
```
wfpiconsole start
```
Depending on the connection type you select, you'll be asked to enter the API
keys you have just generated above, as well as information about your station.
This includes your station ID and device IDs for your AIR, SKY, or TEMPEST
modules. To find this information either open the WeatherFlow app or view your
station page in a web browser. Click on the gear (settings) icon -> Stations ->
[Station name] -> Status.

If all goes smoothly the console should automatically add the extra information
it needs to your configuration file and then start running. You should not need
to enter this configuration information again.

Congratulations, you have installed the PiConsole for the Weather Flow Tempest
and Smart Home Weather Stations.

### Screen size

By default the PiConsole will run in full screen mode. Fullscreen mode can be
disabled in Menu -> Settings -> Display. In this case the console will use the
dimensions specified in the configuration file (```wfpiconsole.ini```), which
can be changed manually. Please note that extreme changes to the aspect ratio
will result in text fields running into one another. Under Settings -> Display
there are also settings to show/hide the cursor and show/hide the window border.

### Remote access

Please note that you cannot use SSH to start the console remotely.  Instead for
remote access it is recommended to setup VNC (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/).
Note there are currently issues using Real VNC (the default VNC provider on
Raspberry Pis) with the latest version of Raspberry  Pi OS (Bookworm): https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/14110635000221-Raspberry-Pi-5-Bookworm-and-RealVNC-Connect

## Update Instructions

The WeatherFlow PiConsole can be updated quickly and easily with the following
command:
```
wfpiconsole update
```
The update process will retain your existing user settings, but may prompt for
input from time to time in order to add new functionality. Once the update has
finished, restart the console using:
```
wfpiconsole start
```

## Auto-Start Instructions

The WeatherFlow PiConsole can be configured to run automatically when the
Raspberry Pi powers up. To enable the console to start automatically, run
```
wfpiconsole autostart-enable
```
To stop the WeatherFlow PiConsole from starting automatically, run
```
wfpiconsole autostart-disable
```
If you are going to use the auto-start method, it is highly recommended that you
can SSH into your Raspberry Pi, as the console can only be stopped using the
stop command or a hard shutdown:
```
wfpiconsole stop
```

## Advanced: Custom Panels

The console is distributed with 7 built-in panels to display weather, forecast
and astronomical information. For advanced users, custom panels can be created
allowing the data display to be customised, or additional data sources to be 
integrated into the console. Custom panels should not be overwritten when the 
console is updated.

The custom panel templates are contained within the `~\wfpiconsole\user` folder. 
To use the custom panel feature, you first need to rename `customPanels.kv.tmpl` 
to `customPanels.kv` and `customPanels.py.tmpl` to `customPanels.py`. An example 
panel called "BigTemperature" is included as an example, and will be loaded the 
next time you start the console.

In the `customPanels.py` file you must create two classes per custom panel called: 
`[panel_name]Panel` and `[panel_name]Button`. "panel_name" can be whatever you want, 
but you must add the two classes that end with Panel and Button per custom panel. 
The classes should be empty (just add pass under the class name), unless you want 
to add methods to your custom panel to control its behaviour. The classes required
for the "BigTemperature" panel can be used as examples. 

In the `customPanels.kv` file you can define the layout of the panel. You need to 
add the two class names that you defined in `customPanels.py` surrounded by left and 
right angled brackets: <>. Again, you can see the "BigTemperature" panel in 
`customPanels.kv.tmpl` as an example. For the Button class, you can change the text 
attribute under PanelButton: to set the name of the panel that will be displayed in 
the bottom bar of the PiConsole. Otherwise leave this class unchanged. For the Panel 
class, the panel title is defined by the _title attribute under PanelTitle:. This can 
be different to the name of the panel that is displayed in the bottom bar. Otherwise 
you are free to define the layout however you want using in-built or custom Kivy 
widgets (https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.html).

## Advanced: Device Replacement

Occasionally it may be necessary to replace your Tempest device due to hardware
failure. Depending on how the replacement Tempest is added to your existing station,
the Tempest device ID and serial number may change. If this is the case, the
`wfpiconsole.ini` file needs to be updated with the new device ID and serial number.
The `.ini` file can either be edited directly, or if  you are not comfortable editing 
the `.ini` file, you can delete it and then restart the console. You will be taken
through the steps to generate a new `.ini` file with the updated device ID and serial
number. 

When a device is replaced, the total monthly/yearly rain accumulation displayed in the
console will also reset to zero as these fields are calculated directly from the 
total rain accumuluation recorded by the new device (which is naturally zero as 
the device is brand new). To retain the correct values, it is necessary to switch
the console to use the Tempest Statistics API endpoint using `Menu` -> `Settings` -> 
`System` -> `Statistics API endpoint`. By default this option is disbaled as it
results in a small loss of accuracy through rounding errors. Therefore it is not 
recommended for use unless you have replaced a device within the last calendar 
year. At the end of a calendar year, the Statistics endoint can be switched off.  

## Advanced Installation: Windows

Although not officially supported, use the following step-by-step instructions
to install and run the WeatherFlow PiConsole on Windows.

1. Download and install the Python 3.11.5 version of Miniconda for Windows (a
lightweight Python interpreter): https://conda.io/miniconda.html

2. Once Miniconda is installed open the ‘Anaconda Prompt’ program.

3. In the Anaconda prompt, run:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

4. Once that process has finished, run:
```
python -m pip install websockets numpy pytz tzlocal ephem packaging pyOpenSSL certifi
```

5. Once that has finished, install Kivy using
```
python -m pip install kivy[base]
```
This is the GUI library that drives the console.

6. Once Kivy is installed, run the following commands in order in the Anaconda
Prompt. This will install the WeatherFlow PiConsole.
```
cd && mkdir wfpiconsole && cd wfpiconsole
curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PiConsole/tarball -o PiConsole.tar.gz
tar -xvf PiConsole.tar.gz --strip 1
del /f PiConsole.tar.gz
```

7. You’re almost there now! You can start the console using ```python main.py```.
As this is the first time you have run the console, you’ll be asked for some API
keys. Details of what you need can be found under "Configure and Run WeatherFlow
PiConsole" in the **[Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)**.
